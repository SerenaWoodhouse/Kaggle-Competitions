# Kaggle-Competitions

In this Kaggle competition we were given a data set of multiple matches played in PubG and were tasked with predicting the winner based on player attributes. Kaggle describes PubG as "100 players are dropped onto an island empty-handed and must explore, scavenge, and eliminate other players until only one is left standing, all while the play zone continues to shrink."
